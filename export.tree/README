This dataset contains the raw fMRI data accompanying the paper "Overlapping but separate number representations in the intraparietal sulcus – probing format- and modality-independence in sighted Braille readers"  Please cite the above paper if you use this data.

The dataset includes:

1. T1-weighted images for each subject 
2. functional whole-brain EPI data from 8 runs for each participant
3. event files containing onsets, durations and trial types for all trials in the corresponding run.

Twenty-five healthy individuals (all female; median age = 25, range = 22–32) participated in the experiment. All participants were right-handed and monolingual, with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Participants were students or graduates with a minimum of 3 years of higher education (median years of higher education = 5; range = 3–12).

In this experiment we used a rapid block design. The numerosities used were: 2,4,6 and 8 and were presented either as visual Arabic digits, visual sets of dots, or tactile Braille numbers.
- Each run lasted 402 seconds and contained 6 stimulus sequences separated by fixation
- Each sequence contained 12 blocks of stimuli
- Each block contained 4–6 trials of the same kind
- In each block, participants had to indicate whether the presented numerosity was higher or lower than 5 by pressing one of the two buttons on the response pad
